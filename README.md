Also in this case is becomes really difficult and hectic job for the people who are concerned for these different activities to happen as there are lots of people who all have different kinds of issues and queries. So this project will not only help the residents of the society but it will also help security guards, secretary, accountants etc. Therefore this project aims in building an Apartment Management System which will help in overcoming these barriers as well as help each and every person around in every possible way it can.
